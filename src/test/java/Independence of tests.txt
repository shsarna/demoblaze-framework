In order to make the tests independent of each other in the given context, we can follow multiple precautions like:

1. Rather than relying on pre-existing data or data generated by previous test cases, Generate test data for each test scenario within the test case itself.

2. create the necessary data (e.g., company, customer, article) in the test case itself and clear the same by the end of the test case by implementing tear-down methods.
